8.In how many ways can a CSS be integrated as a web page? 

 1. Inline CSS: Inline CSS involves placing the CSS directly within the HTML elements using the style attribute.

2.  Internal CSS: Internal CSS is embedded within the <style> element in the <head> section of the HTML document.
    This method is useful when applying styles to a single web page.

3.  External CSS: External CSS involves linking an external CSS file to the HTML document using the <link> element
    in the <head> section. This method is preferred for larger projects as it allows for better organization and 
    easier maintenance of styles across multiple web pages
