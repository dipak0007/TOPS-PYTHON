"""What is tuple? Difference between list and tuple. """

"""
 tuple is an immutable sequence of values. This means once a tuple is created, its elements cannot be
 changed or modified. Tuples are defined by enclosing the comma-separated values within parentheses ().

 example of a tuple:
 my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
 mixed_tuple = (1, "two", 3.0, True)



Difference between list and tuple :
-Lists are mutable, meaning you can modify, add, or remove elements after the list is created.
-Tuples are immutable, meaning once a tuple is created, you cannot change, add, or remove its elements.

-Lists are defined by enclosing comma-separated values within square brackets [].
-Tuples are defined by enclosing comma-separated values within parentheses ().
