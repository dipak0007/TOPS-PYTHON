"""ï‚· Can one block of except statements handle multiple exception? """

"""Yes, one block of except statements in Python can handle multiple exceptions. 
You can specify multiple exception types in a single except block by enclosing them 
in parentheses and separating them with commas. This allows you to handle different 
types of exceptions with the same block of code."""
