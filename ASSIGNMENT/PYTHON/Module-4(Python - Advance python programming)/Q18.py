""" What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed? """
"""
When the expression "1" == 1 is executed in Python, it compares the string "1" to the integer 1.

Python evaluates this expression according to its rules for comparison operators. In this case, it returns False. 
This is because the == operator compares the values of the operands, and since one operand is a string and 
the other is an integer, they are considered different types and therefore not equal."""
