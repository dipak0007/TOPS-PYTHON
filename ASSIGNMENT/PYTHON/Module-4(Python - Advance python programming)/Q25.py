"""ï‚·Explain Inheritance in Python with an example? What is init? Or What
Is A Constructor In Python?
"""
"""Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) where a class
 (called a subclass or derived class) can inherit attributes and methods from another class 
 (called a superclass or base class). This allows for code reuse and promotes a hierarchical 
 structure in your codebase.

 __init__() is a special method, also known as a constructor. It's automatically called when you create a 
 new instance of a class. The purpose of the __init__() method is to initialize the instance variables 
 (attributes) of the object. You can think of it as the method that sets up the initial state of the object.
